V2 of Onboarding Guide Complete (splitting onboarding as well as Git tutorials): https://cwa-onboarding.s3.amazonaws.com/onboarding-orientation/CWA-OnboardingOrientation/index.html

V1 of Git Tutorial https://cwa-onboarding.s3.amazonaws.com/CWA-Git-Tutorials/CWA-GitCloneCommitPull/CWA-GitCloneCommitPull/index.html

Might take a second to load the Git Tutorial. It can be split up into multiple if needed, but for now is all in one.
Cannot resize the simulations, even if recorded with different dimensions. Its because of the software itself
Hosted on AWS but looking into how to make it work on github pages
Lmk any feedback, suggestions, etc., (edited)
